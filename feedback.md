## Code Quality - Progressing

Criteria: Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

-   Nice work creating trivia questions with DOM manipulation and avoiding hard-coding questions into your HTML. Will make scaling this application easier if you want to add more questions in the future.
-   Code is formatted and linted with proper spacing and indentations.
-   There is commented out, non-functional code in your `script.js` file. Next time be sure to remove any non-functional code before turning in a project.

## Technical Requirements - Incomplete

Criteria: Renders in browser with no major errors and separates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

-   All answers on the trivia quiz are counted incorrect. Your `checkAnswer` function needs to be revisited in order for users to get accurate feedback on their answer choices.
-   Reaching the end of the questions causes error messages in the console.

## Creativity and Interface - Progressing

Criteria: The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

-   Design is simple and easy to read
-   Alert windows to provide feedback to users are not ideal for modern applications

## Presentation - Incomplete

Criteria: Application has functional and creative interface and a readme with relevant information about the application.

-   There is a brief summary of the game in the README.md as well as wire-frame images in the repo, but nothing else is covered in the documentation of how you planned and created your project.
