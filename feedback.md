# Project 1 Feedback

## Code Quality - Progressing

Criteria: Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

### Strengths:

-   Nice work creating the trivia questions with DOM manipulation and avoiding hard-coding questions into HTML. Will make scaling this application easier if more questions will be added.
-   Good job distinguishing when to use `const` and `let` in variable assignments.
-   Code is formatted and linted with proper spacing and indentations.

### Areas for Growth:

-   There is commented out, non-functional code in the `script.js` file. Next time remove any non-functional code before turning in a project.

## Technical Requirements - Incomplete

Criteria: Renders in browser with no major errors and separates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Strengths:

-   Successfully deployed, and project renders in browser with no errors.
-   Content, style, and functionality are separated in distinct HTML, CSS and JS files.

### Areas for Growth:

-   All answers on the trivia quiz are scored as incorrect. The `checkAnswer` function needs to be revisited in order for users to get accurate feedback on their answer choices.
-   Reaching the end of the questions causes error messages in the console. The last question should be followed by another screen or message that provides user feedback on the overall quiz.

## Creativity and Interface - Progressing

Criteria: The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

### Strengths:

-   Design is simple and easy to read, with large fonts and clean layout.
-   Straightforward color scheme that allows user to focus on the questions.

### Areas for Growth

-   Alert windows to provide feedback to users are not ideal for modern applications. Consider a different approach to providing user feedback via DOM manipulation.
-   Consider using CSS and images to add a more personal touch to the app's user interface.

## Presentation - Incomplete

Criteria: Application has functional and creative interface and a readme with relevant information about the application.

### Strengths:

-   User interface is functional and README is present.

### Areas for Growth:

-   There is a brief summary of the game in the README.md as well as wire-frame images in the repo, but nothing else is covered in the documentation of how the project was planned and created.

## Hard Requirements

- [x] The project is deployed to GitHub Pages or a custom domain
- [ ] The application renders in the browser and runs without errors
- [ ] The repo has a README that adequately documents the project
