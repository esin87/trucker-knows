# Project 1 Feedback

## Code Quality - Progressing

Criteria: Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

### Strengths:

-   Nice work creating the trivia questions with DOM manipulation and avoiding hard-coding questions into HTML. Will make scaling this application easier if more questions will be added.
-   Good job distinguishing when to use `const` and `let` in variable assignments.
-   Code is formatted and linted with proper spacing and indentations.
- Variables are named in a way that reveals their purpose and functionality.

### Areas for Growth:

-   There is commented out, non-functional code in the `script.js` file. Next time remove any non-functional code before turning in a project.

## Technical Requirements - Incomplete

Criteria: How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

### Strengths:

-   Successfully deployed, and project renders in browser.
-   Content, style, and functionality are separated in distinct HTML, CSS and JS files.

### Areas for Growth:

- [x] The project is deployed to GitHub Pages or a custom domain
- [ ] The application renders in the browser and runs without errors
- [ ] The repo has a README that adequately documents the project

## Creativity and Interface - Progressing

Criteria: Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

### Strengths:

-   Design is simple and easy to read, with large fonts and clean layout.
-   Straightforward color scheme that allows user to focus on the questions.

### Areas for Growth

-   Alert windows to provide feedback to users are not ideal for modern applications. Consider a different approach to providing user feedback via DOM manipulation.
-   Consider using CSS and images to add a more personal touch to the app's user interface.

## Functionality - Incomplete

Criteria: Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

### Strengths: 

- Application loads without errors. User is immediately able to begin answering questions.

### Areas for Growth: 

-   All answers on the trivia quiz are scored as incorrect. The `checkAnswer` function needs to be revisited in order for users to get accurate feedback on their answer choices.
-   Reaching the end of the questions causes error messages in the console. The last question should be followed by another screen or message that provides user feedback on the overall quiz.

## Presentation - Incomplete

Criteria: Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

### Strengths:

-   README is present in the repo, and files are titled with intuitive names.

### Areas for Growth:

-   There is a brief summary of the game in the README.md as well as wire-frame images in the repo, but there should be more information in the README of how the project was planned and created.
